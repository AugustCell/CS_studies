General notes on cpp language

Initializer list - A way of intializing all member vairables of a class or a struct upon entry.
				   Similar to uniform intiailziation.

Narrowing conversion - This will basicaly convert whatever is set on the RValue, and change the type to
					   what is on the LValue side. 
					   int x = 2.7 (x = 2)

Uniform initialization - This prevent narrowing conversions, and will raise compiler time errors to make 
						 sure that you are setting your LValue correctly.
